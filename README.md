## VBA Stock Anaylsis

#### Background

Use VBA scripting to analyze generated stock market data.

#### Analysis

Create a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:

* The ticker symbol.
* Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
* The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
* The total stock volume of the stock.
* Add functionality to your script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume". 
* Make the appropriate adjustments to your VBA script to allow it to run on every worksheet (that is, every year) just by running the VBA script once.
